The following JSON structure represents an input field from a form data.
Your task is to fill the `value` field using the provided user data.
Follow these instructions:

- For a field where the `name` matches the pattern "How many years of experience do you have in *?", set the `value` field to "2".
- For any other field:
  - If you can find a relevant value in the provided user data, use it.
  - If no relevant information exists, set the `value` field to an empty string (`""`).
- Retain all other fields and their attributes (e.g., `id`, `class`, `label`, etc.) exactly as they are.
- Do not add new fields or change the structure of the JSON.
- Ensure that the updated JSON contains all original fields with their updated `value`.
- DO NOT provide any introduction, explanation, or outro.
